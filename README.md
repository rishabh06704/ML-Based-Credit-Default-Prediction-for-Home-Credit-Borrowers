## ML-Based-Credit-Default-Prediction-for-Home-Credit-Borrowers

#### Overview

This research paper explores the use of machine learning techniques for credit default prediction in the context of Home Credit borrowers. The objective was to design predictive models that can accurately identify borrowers at risk of default, enabling financial institutions to improve risk management and lending decisions.

---

#### Key Contributions

Applied classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Passive Aggressive to borrower datasets.

Conducted feature engineering on demographic, financial, and credit history variables to enhance predictive accuracy.

Evaluated models with key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure robustness.

Highlighted the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive power when selecting models.

---

#### Outcomes

Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, delivering strong overall accuracy and high precision for the default class, with opportunities to further improve recall via threshold tuning/class rebalancing.

Results demonstrate the potential for data-driven decision-making in lending, helping reduce default rates and support financial inclusion.
